# Credit-card-defaulter-app

Objective of this project is to identify the key drivers that determine the likelihood of credit card default and
Predict the likelihood of credit card default for customers of the Bank.This app is deployed using Tkinter,a standard GUI library for Python..Model development is based on categorization methods as Logistic Regression,Decision Tree Classifier, KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms. For Logistic Regression, the models give precisions of 78%, for Naive Bayes 38%,% for Decision Tree and 76% for KNN.This app compares the results by these following algorithms and gives significant accuracy with these methods.This project was from the Hackathon conducted by kaggle.
